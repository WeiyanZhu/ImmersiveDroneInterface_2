# ISAACS Virtual Reality Interface (Version 2.0) for the DJI Matrice 210
<br>

**TODO: Logo**
<br>
<br>

The Immersive Semi-Autonomous Aerial Command System (ISAACS) is an undergraduate research group within the Center for Augmented Cognition of the VHL Vive Center for Enhanced Reality at the University of California, Berkeley. Our research focuses on human-computer interaction, with an emphasis on teleoperation and telesensing with quadrotors.
<br>

The ISAACS Virtual Reality Interface is part of our broader vision to help augment human perception, and integrates robot vision and radiation sensing with an intuitive User Interface that enables the command of a swarm of quadrotors. Currently, direct manipulation (using natural hand motion) of the mission-ready DJI Matrice 210 is supported, while sensor integration is still at an experimental stage.
<br>

This repository is a continuation of the original ISAACS Interface, aimed at the Bitcraze Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotors. We have decided to design for the Matrice 210, given its ability to support a greater range of sensors and mission-critical tasks.

## Branches
Upstream development happens on the Alpha branch. Once most bugs have been eliminated, changes are pushed on the Beta branch for testing. The Master branch gets updated only when the interface is demo-ready.
